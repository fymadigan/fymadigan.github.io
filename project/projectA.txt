Bainbridge Hoopfest was the first major webiste I coded that was designed for the general public and not for a class project. This event was to take place in March of 2018 as a 3 vs 3 basketball tournament for Kitsap County. This website was to be the go-to place for any information for it and was a project I was thrilled to work on. Unfortunately, the support for it got pulled by administration late in the game, after the webiste was near completion. I include this website on my portfolio because I consider it one of my greatest successes and failures due to the work and dedication I put into trying to make it happen. The webiste can be accessed on my GitHub repo or through. Please note some functionalities might be broken now - such as the countdown clock as it was designed to go to the date and not optimized to go later.
