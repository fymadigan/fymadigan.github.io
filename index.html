                        <div class="content">Bainbridge Hoopfest was the first major webiste I coded that was designed for the general public and not for a class project. This event was to take place in March of 2018 as a 3 vs 3 basketball tournament for Kitsap County. This website was to be the go-to place for any information for it and was a project I was thrilled to work on. Unfortunately, the support for it got pulled by administration late in the game, after the webiste was near completion. I include this website on my portfolio because I consider it one of my greatest successes and failures due to the work and dedication I put into trying to make it happen. The webiste can be accessed on my GitHub repo or through. Please note some functionalities might be broken now - such as the countdown clock as it was designed to go to the date and not optimized to go later.

Very simple static HTML page but utilized Javascript, a language I'm not very familiar with to be the main point of this project. The user must click the space bar after they see the green flash as fast as they can while the toggle is on and the same once it's off. The toggle changes the delay in animation and supposedly once a user gets used to the delayed one, they feel a sensation of a lack of free will when it happens so quickly.

I especially enjoyed this project for its scoreboard that stays updated. This site did experience some bugs especially since the popups were "< a >" link tags so one would have to reset their history in order to "clear the board" but I had a lot of fun putting it together and learning about the LaTex math script.

While the app never went live this was a great experience because it was the first truly successful collabrative assignment. My team was comprised of four boys where the majority of the workload was split between myself and one other person who knew a considerable more so I was able to learn a lot from him in all aspects of this project.

For this, I decided to use WordPress for the blog style format and easy access so other officers were able to easily access the side. This was the first time I used WordPress from scratch as previously I was the webmaster for my high school's newspaper in my senior year so it was interesting to work with.

                          NW Hacks 2019 was my first hackathon and for it my team created BeatBallot. I worked on the front-end using React, HTML, and CSS, effectively turning the sketches
                          into the reality. Within 24 ours, our team developed a fully functional application.
                          <br />
                          The concept behind BeatBallot is users can host a room that anyone can join via a QR code - oor six alphanumeric string. Once in the room, users can suggest songs to the
                          host playlist that are then voted on by other guests in the room. Once a song recieves more downvotes than upvotes, the song will be axed fromm the playlist.
                          The songs within the playlist will play based on most likes first but if they are tied, they will be played oldest added to newest.

                          This project was for DubHacks 2019. I worked on the front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and turned the Figma low fidelity sketches into a dynamic web app. Our project was announced as top 3 for the Microsoft Sponsor prize. 
                          <br />
                          We wanted our project to help a community and one thing we decided was that websites are often cluttered, confusing, and overstimulating for many but especially for those who identify as autisitic. Our webapp can take any website and then display it in one clean format which encourages consistency and ultimately provides a cleaner viewing experience.
